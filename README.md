## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to summarize temperature trends for the months of June and December throughout the years. The data is then supposed to be used to determine if the ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. The data is summarized to show basic statistical measurements like average, max, and min.
## Results
From the results, we can see that:

* The standard deviation is fairly the same for both charts, it is also small so this shows that there is not much variation among the results collected.
* The December chart has 183 less observations, though since our sample size is still very high, we should not have to worry too much about that.
* The average, min, and max are fairly the same across both charts, during the month of December there is a small drop in temperature, but this is to be expected given that it is winter.

Below we can see both charts side-by-side:



## Summary
From what we can see, the temperature is stable all year round. There should not be any problems with maintaining shop sustainability throughout the year. This sounds great, but temperature never tells the whole story. Other ways we can make sure our data is telling the whole story is if we analyze precipitation. We can also try to collect data on humidity. It would not matter if the temperature is fine if it ends up raining six out of seven days of the week.

A query to collect data on precipitation for the months of June and December can be taken to determine if the climate is optimal. We can also create a query that shows what stations are the most active during the months of December and June. With that data, we can decide on location and a number of other things.
